- Created a web application with free trail of Apple Music API.
- Users can search and listen songs. Since API is paid, so for now, users can only listen every song for just 30 seconds.
- Created very basic backend using Node.js and Express.js with very basic user registration and authentication feature where we use MongoDB Atlas to store user information.
- Used React and MUI to create a very minimalist and simple frontend design.
- NOTE : The backend is hosted on free instance of 'Render' which spins down after 15 minutes of inactivity. So, it may cause a 40-50 seconds delay while restarting the server again that's why please expect some delay to load the site for the first time after inactivity.
