# M-Player
- Created a web application with free trail of Apple Music API.
- Users can search and listen songs. Since API is paid, so for now, users can only listen every song for just 30 seconds.
- Engineered a high-performance serverless backend using Hono framework and Cloudflare Workers, optimizing API response times and reducing infrastructure costs.
- Developed a secure and scalable backend system, implementing comprehensive user management with registration and authentication. Integrated Neon DBâ€™s Postgres with Prisma ORM for efficient and reliable user data storage, ensuring high performance and data integrity.
- Designed a minimalist and simple frontend using React and various libraries.

## Project History
- Initially developed a backend using Express and Node.js to manage API services and handle server-side logic.
- Identified the need for a more scalable and efficient solution, leading to the migration of the backend to a serverless architecture using Hono and Prisma.
- Successfully streamlined deployment, improved scalability, and reduced server management overhead by adopting serverless technologies.
